# ScalaRedBlackTree
ScalaRedBlackTree is a Scala-based implementation of the Red-Black Tree algorithm, a type of balanced binary search tree ensuring efficient data search with O(log(N)) time complexity. The project is designed using object-oriented principles, featuring a trait Tree[X] that provides abstract methods for checking if an element exists and for inserting elements into the tree. The tree structure is represented by two case classes, Leaf and Node, with nodes containing data, two subtrees, and color attributes (red or black). The Node class includes a balance method for rebalancing the tree after an insertion, ensuring the tree's properties remain intact. A driver program is provided to demonstrate the creation and manipulation of the tree, outputting visual representations of the tree structure as DOT graphs for easy visualization. This project is ideal for learning about balanced binary trees, Scala's functional programming capabilities, and its application of traits, case classes, and pattern matching.
